# Computer Graphics Lab For Jilin University

I have developed this experiment framework for update the labs of the Computer Graphics course, offered at Jilin University.

The framework comprises 13 concise exercises, guiding you through the process of creating 2D graphics and rendering 3D objects on your personal computer screen from scratch.

If you have any advice, please feel free to contact me. Let's work together to make the Computer Graphics more engaging and accessible.

## Lab Contents

### Graphics 2D

1.  **Draw a Line**
2.  **Draw a BÃ©zier Curve**
3.  **Draw a Rectangle**
4.  **Draw a Polygon**
5.  **Draw a Circle**
6.  **Fill Polygon with Color**
7.  **Fill Circle with Color**
8.  **Translation Transformation**
9.  **Rotation Transformation**

### Graphics 3D

The Graphics3D library is constructed as a pipeline:

10. **Complete MVP Processor**
11. **Complete Vertex Processor**
12. **Complete Rasterizer (Allows visualization of a 3D object)**
13. **Complete Lighting Processor (Implement Blinn-Phong Model)**
14. **Complete Texture Processor**

Additional instructions can be found in the `lab.ipynb` file.
